        <P> To demystify molecular biology for youths in Kenya through education outreach and public engagement-making science accessible ,relevant and empowering for all

            Genes for change KE is a youth led initiative transforming the way Kenyan students and communities understand molecular biology and genetics .through science education, hands on workshop and public health awareness ,we connect the power of DNA to the issues that matter most from hereditary diseases to future careers in stem .we believe science isnt just for labs -its for life and it start here.

                  <p>
                    To ignite curiosity and confidence in science among Kenyan children aged 7–17 by making genetics and molecular biology accessible, engaging, and culturally relevant — starting in the classroom, and reaching into communities.

                  <p>
                    A future where young African learners are not just science-literate, but science-leaders — pioneering research, innovating solutions, and transforming their communities through the power of STEM.

                Genes for Change started with a simple yet powerful idea — what if science didn’t wait until university? What if it began in the curiosity of a 10-year-old?

                    <h3>The Question</h3>
                    <p>We asked: why don't more children in Kenya see themselves in science? Why are labs and DNA concepts reserved for later in life?</p>
