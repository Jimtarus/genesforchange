        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          We deliver hands-on genetics and molecular biology education through school workshops, virtual labs, and community STEM clubs. We also support teachers with resources and training.

        <h3>Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          We inspire youth to think like scientists and innovators. From student research projects to national biotech hackathons, we nurture curiosity and critical thinking.

        <h3>Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          We run campaigns, podcasts, and school talks to demystify genetics and build public understanding of how DNA science touches everyday life.

      <h2>From Curiosity to Breakthroughs</h2>
      <p>
        In a rural school outside Kisumu, a 16-year-old student once asked during a workshop,
        <em>"Can DNA explain why crops fail even with enough rain?"</em> That curiosity led her to a mentorship program where she explored plant genetics and eventually presented her findings at a national science fair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories like this fuel our work. Because when young people discover that the science of genes can answer their everyday questions, it becomes personal. Powerful. Possible.
