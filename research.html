        <h3>Student Research Projects</h3>
        <p>
          We mentor high school students to conduct original research in genetics and molecular biology. Projects include studies on local plant genomics, disease genetics, and DNA barcoding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our students have been featured in national expos, showcasing community-centered genetic solutions.

      <h2>Case Study: DNA Barcoding in Baringo</h2>
      <p>
        Partnering with a rural school in Baringo County, students used home-built DNA extraction kits to study plants around Lake Baringo. Their research was presented at the African Junior Science Forum and added to a national biodiversity database.
      </p>
      <p>
        This success shows how accessible, locally-led science can put Kenyan youth at the forefront of global discovery.
